# My custom fork of vMenu that adds plugin functionality with lua exports.

- I also added an "Update Character Clothing" button to the manage saved character menu, which allows for saving clothing set by an EUP menu or anything else.

I'm not a C# programmer, and I assume this was not done in a way that would be acceptable to PR without decent effort refactoring. If anyone want's to try though feel free!
